# Nvim WriteOnly

A plugin to help you not become your own worst enemy.

This plugin temporaily disables most editing features, and forces you into insert mode to write.

When you're done, you can tap `<esc>` 15 (!) times to get out.

Enable with `:Writeonly`

## Editing while writing:

only `<C-w>` works, and only once after a period of writing.
Backspace, delete, and the arrow keys are disabled.
